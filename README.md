# Face-Mask-Detection
In this project, work on an image classification issue with a limited amount of training examples per category. The data repository contains images of human faces with mask and without mask, and the goal of the assignment is to create a heuristic and robust model that can detect human face with mask and without mask.
<br />The main objective of this project is(are) to: <br />
•	Collect images of people with and without wearing a face mask and pre-process it along with some data augmentation. <br />
•	Feed the compatible dataset to a Deep Learning Neural Network Model Architecture like MobileNetV2, VGG-16, Xception etc. and train it with pre-trained weights of ImageNet.<br /> 
•	Integrate the above model with Computer Vision libraries allowing it to use the web-cam of the computer to test the model in real-time. <br />
•	Carry out inferences from Model Evaluation.<br /> 
•	Plot the accuracies and losses in training and testing phase. <br />
